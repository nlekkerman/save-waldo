## Bugs

As a newcomer to Python development, I encountered several bugs during the development process. However, I diligently worked through them and resolved most of them in the code. Below is documentation for one of the bugs I encountered:

### Bug 1: Print Validation Error in `play_password_level()`

- **Description**:
  - As a newcomer to Python development, I encountered issues with proper syntax enclosure in a print statement in the `play_password_level()` function.
  - The error occurred in the following code snippet:
    ```python
    print(Fore.GREEN +
          "All numbers are revealed!"
          " Please enter the complete password now: "
          + Fore.RESET + Fore.YELLOW + ''.join(map(str, password)
          + Fore.RESET))
    ```
  - The issue was that `Fore.RESET` was placed outside of the print statement's parenthesis, causing a syntax error.

- **Bug Fix**:
  - To resolve the issue, I enclosed the entire print statement properly within the parenthesis.
  - Here's the corrected code:
    ```python
    print(Fore.GREEN +
          "All numbers are revealed!"
          " Please enter the complete password now: "
          + Fore.RESET + Fore.YELLOW + ''.join(map(str, password))
          + Fore.RESET)
    ```
  - Before Fix:
